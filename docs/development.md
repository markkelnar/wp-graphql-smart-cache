We recommend using Docker for local development. With the instructions below, you can use Docker to build the app in an isolated environment with a local running WordPress + WPGraphQL. You can also use Docker to run the test suites.

## Plugin Build

Use one of the following commands to build the plugin source and it's dependencies. Do this at least once after initial checkout or after updating composer.json.

	composer install --optimize-autoloader

	composer update --optimize-autoloader

One option is to use a docker image to run php/composer:

	docker run -v $PWD:/app composer install --optimize-autoloader

## WordPress App

This section describes how to setup and run this plugin, WP and the wp-graphql plugin locally with docker. It requires building the images (see above) at least once, which can take a few moments the first time.

### Build

Use one of the following commands to build the local images for the app and testing.

#### docker-compose

Build all images in the docker compose configuration. Requires having built your own wp-graphql local images.

	WP_VERSION=5.9  PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose build --build-arg WP_VERSION=5.9 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.0

Build fresh docker image without cache by adding `--no-cache`.

	WP_VERSION=5.9  PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose build --build-arg WP_VERSION=5.9 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.0 --no-cache

Build using wp-graphql image from docker hub registry, instead of building your own wp-graphql image.

	WP_VERSION=5.9  PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose build --build-arg WP_VERSION=5.9 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.0 --build-arg DOCKER_REGISTRY=ghcr.io/wp-graphql/

#### docker

Use this command if you want to build a specific image. If you ran the docker-compose command above, this is not necessary.

	docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t wp-graphql-smart-cache:latest-wp5.6-php8.0 --build-arg WP_VERSION=5.6 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.0 .

### Run

Use one of the following to start the WP app with the plugin installed and running. After running, navigate to the app in a web browser at http://localhost:8091/

	docker compose up app

This is an example of specifying the WP and PHP version for the wp-graphql images.

	WP_VERSION=5.9 PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker compose up app

### Shell

Use one of the following if you want to access the WP app with bash command shell.

	docker-compose run app bash

	WP_VERSION=5.9 PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose run app bash

### Stop

Use this command to stop the running app and database.

	docker-compose stop

### Use a local wp-graphql plugin

If you have a copy of the wp-graphql plugin you'd like to use in the running app, Add this to volumes section in docker-compose.yml.

	  - './local-wp-graphql:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/wp-graphql'

## WordPress Tests

Use this section to run the plugin test suites.

### Build

Use one of the following commands to build the test docker image.

#### docker-compose

If you ran the docker-compose build command, above, this step is not necessary and you should already have the build docker image, skip to run.

#### docker

	WP_VERSION=5.9 PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.testing -t wp-graphql-smart-cache-testing:latest-wp5.7.2-php7.4 --build-arg WP_VERSION=5.9 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.0 --build-arg DOCKER_REGISTRY=ghcr.io/wp-graphql/ .

	docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.testing -t wp-graphql-smart-cache-testing:latest-wp5.7.2-php7.4 --build-arg WP_VERSION=5.9 --build-arg PHP_VERSION=8.0 --build-arg DOCKER_REGISTRY=ghcr.io/wp-graphql/ .

### Run

Use one of these commands to run the test suites.

	WP_VERSION=5.9 PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose run testing

	docker-compose run testing

Use the DEBUG environment variable to see the codeception debug during tests.

	WP_VERSION=5.9 PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose run -e DEBUG=1 testing

### Shell

Use one of the following if you want to access the WP testing app with bash command shell.

	docker-compose run --entrypoint bash testing

This is an example of specifying the WP and PHP version for the wp-graphql images.

	WP_VERSION=5.9 PHP_VERSION=8.0 docker-compose run --entrypoint bash testing

## Network Cache

Use these steps to run a network cache (varnish) to similate the caching behavior of graphql requests and invalidation during content updates.

	WP_VERSION=6.1 PHP_VERSION=8.1 docker compose up varnish

The varnish app starts and listens at http://localhost:8081/ for requests.

Test a graphql query to load post #1 "Hello World" at this 'http://localhost:8081/graphql?query={ post(id: "1", idType: DATABASE_ID) { title } }'

### Cache Requests

Send graphql request to http://localhost:8081/graphql end point. You will see caching headers in the response.

Initial return will miss the cache and access the WordPress backend.

```
X-Cache: Miss
```

Subsequent requests that have cached content will return that without accessing the backend WordPress.

```
X-Cache: HIT: 1
```

Also note the correspeonding Graphql specific headers in the response.

```
X-Graphql-Query-Id:
X-Graphql-Url:
```

### Purge Cache

Add this code to your WordPress to handle invalidation with the running varnish server.

```
add_action(
	'graphql_purge',
	function ( $purge_keys, $event = 'event', $url = '' ) {
		$headers =
		$response = wp_remote_post(
			'http://varnish',
			[
				'method' => 'PURGE_GRAPHQL',
				'headers' => [
					'GraphQL-Purge-Keys' => $purge_keys,
					'GraphQL-URL'        => graphql_get_endpoint_url(),
				],
			],
		);
		error_log( "GRAPHQL_PURGE $url $purge_keys ". $response['body'] );
	},
	10,
	3
);
```

Run some graphql requests and verify seeing the cached response. Change content (mutation or Wp-Admin) and verify what was invalidated (purged) from cache.

If using WP-Admin to change content, login at http://localhost:8091 in a different browser or incognito from where you are testing cached graphql queries.

After data is invalidate, your previously cache request will access the WP backend for fresh data and show `X-Cache: Miss` in the response headers.
